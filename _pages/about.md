I am currently a third year PhD student from the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yale University, and I am so honored to be supervised by [Prof. Harrison Zhou](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~hz68/). <br><br>

Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University (2015.9-2019.7). I have wide research interests including theoretical statistics and machine learning theory. My research goal is to design efficient and provable algorithms, to deepen the statistical understanding, and to provide new perspective for practical machine learning problems. Recently, my main research interest lies in generative models.

## Experiences
 - 6/2022 - 9/2022:
   Worked as a student researcher at Google AI in the Lux Group advised by Ankur Parikh, Ran Tian, Lei Tao and Behnam Neyshabur. During the internship, I studied a new version of T5 encoder-decoder language pretraining models, and apply them to natural language generation and protein generation, showing much better performance.

 - 9/2018 - 12/2018:
   Participated in an internship of Microsoft Research Asia in the machine learning group advised by Weidong Ma. Using reinforcement learning and imitation learning to solve combinatorial optimization and transportation management problem.
 - 9/2018 - 6/2019:
   Researched, as a research assistant, the “environmental policies analysis” program and being in charge of coding and natural language processing. Collaborated with Dr. Yingdan Lu from Department of Communication, Stanford University and Prof. Xiao Tang from Tsinghua University. 
 - 3/2018 - 7/2018:
   Participated in an internship of Baidu Inc. in the data analysis group advised by Miao Fan and Mingming Sun. Using new natural language processing techniques to design new models for text classification, dialogue generation and automatic QA. <br>
